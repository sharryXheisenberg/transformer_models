## What is BERT ?
- BERT stands for “Bidirectional Encoder Representation with Transformers”. To put it in simple words BERT extracts patterns or representations from the data or word embeddings by passing it through an encoder. The encoder itself is a transformer architecture that is stacked together. It is a bidirectional transformer which means that during training it considers the context from both left and right of the vocabulary to extract patterns or representations.
